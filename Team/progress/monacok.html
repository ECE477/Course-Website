This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, available online at https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Course/Policies/policies.html

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,

            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 11 September 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 7<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td style="width: 200px; text-align: center; font-size: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0; line-height: 15px;"><img src="../img/SparkFun_OLED.jpg" style="height: 100px;"><br><b>Figure 1: </b><i>SparkFun TOLED Graphical Breakout Display </i>[1]</td>
                    <td>My main focus this week was researching different Transparent OLED displays to use in our
                        project and determining which component specifications were the most important to consider
                        when choosing our display. After comparing three different displays, I decided on the SparkFun
                        Transparent Graphical OLED Breakout display. This display supports I2C and SPI interfaces.
                        I performed preliminary research to review each protocol and determine the pros and cons of
                        using one or the other.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br>I2C and SPI are serial communication protocols commonly used to transfer data between a microcontroller
            and peripheral devices. Both utilize the Master-Slave relationship scheme for their functionality.<br><br>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td style="text-align: center; font-size: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-right: 10px; line-height: 15px;"><img src="../img/SPI_Set_up.png" style="height: 150px;"><br><b>Figure 2: </b><i>SPI Master-Slave Diagram </i>[2]</td>
                    <td>SPI uses 4 basic signals for communication: SCLK, MOSI, MISO, and SS. SCLK is the Serial Clock
                        that allows the master and slave to communicate synchronously and is defined by the Master.
                        MOSI (Master Out Slave In) is the pin through which the Master sends data to the Slave. MISO
                        (Master In Slave Out) is the pin through which the Slave sends data back to the Master.
                        Finally, SS (Slave Select) lets the slave know that the Master is trying to communicate with it.
                        Having multiple Slave Selects allows multiple Slaves to be connected to one Master. The SS
                        signal attached to the desired slave is pulled low to indicate which slave the Master wishes to
                        communicate with. Data can be sent serially to and from the slave until the transmission is complete.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br>
            I2C uses 2 basic signals for communication: SCL and SDA. SCL is the Serial Clock that allows the master and
            slave to communicate synchronously and is defined by the Master. SDA is the Serial Data signal that can
            send information to and from the Master and Slave. Unlike SPI which sends data in a continuous stream of
            bits, I2C sends data bits through packets. The packet includes a Start bit, an Address Frame to indicate
            which Slave is in use, a Read/Write bit, an ACK/NACK bit, one or more data frames (which include 8 bits of
            data followed by an ACK/NACK bit), and a Stop bit to signal the end of the packet.<br>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 10px;"><img src="../img/I2C_Message.png" style="width: 500px;"><br><b>Figure 3: </b><i>I2C Packet Structure </i>[3]</b></p>
            <br>
            Between the two protocols, SPI is preferred because it is able to transfer data faster than I2C so that
            the display can more quickly relay user metric information and toggle between screens as needed. The
            microcontrollers we are currently considering have 3 SPI peripherals which accommodates the OLED Display,
            LoRa Radio Transceiver, and IMU Receiver - the three components that require SPI in our design. In the event
            that a different component requires the use of SPI, the OLED can be converted to using I2C in exchange for
            increased display update time.
