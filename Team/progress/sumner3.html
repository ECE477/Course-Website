This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, available online at https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Course/Policies/policies.html

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

            <h2>Progress Report for Peter Sumner</h2>

            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9-9-2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 6<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			<td>Throughout the project I will be working on implementing the GPS module. The focus of this week was to research GPS operation and possible 
				GPS modules to use. GPS receivers use a satellite constellation of at least 24 satellites to calculate potision at a given time. To do this calculation 
				accurately the receiver must be able to lock onto 4 satellites and the satellite configuration ensures that this is always possible [1].

					<td>Only basic functionality of a GPS is needed to receive coordinate and alititude data as required for the project. Since the GPS 
						requirements are minimal, the feature I determined to be most important was power consumption. The goggles will be battery operated for hours at 
						a time and selecting low power components is key. Some modules, like the MTK3339 by Adafruit, have a sleep mode that can be activated to lower
						consumption further [2]. The GPS will only be actively receiving when requested by the user so this could be a useful fucntion.<br>

				The next step is to aqcuire the physical GPS module and begin experimenting with its functionality.

			<h4>Week 2:</h4> 
			<b>Date:</b> 9-18-2020<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 6<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			<table>
				<td>This week I ordered a GPS breakout, specifically the Ultimate GPS Breakout from Adafruit [3]. Unfortunately, the parts did not arrive in time 
					to begin working with the module this week. Nevertheless, I did some digging to determine how to properly program the GPS and set up a testing 
					environment with Arduino. Adafruit has published a GPS library compatible with the module that is open-source and can be found on GitHub [4].
					The relevant functions and variables to this project are found in the header file. The GPS module can be connected via either SPI or I2C and in 
					addition to housing functions, the library also contains basic examples for how each could be structured. 
					<br>

				<td>A portion of an Arduino script is shown on the left that establishes working communication with the GPS module. The setup section
					sets the baud rate and configures the GPS output. It then enters a loop as the GPS receives and digests data. GPS data is packaged in the form of National Marine 
					Electronics Association (NMEA) sentences [5]. Each sentence contains all of the data collected for a specific point in time. When the GPS receives an NMEA sentence 
					each variable must be extracted individually. <br>
				<br>As data for each of the individual variables is collected it is printed to the console output. Once the hardware portion is implemented, this will enable 
					me to assess the accuracy of data received as well as mirror the display a goggle wearer will have in the final implementation of the project.
