This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, available online at https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Course/Policies/policies.html

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

            <h2>Progress Report for Peter Sumner</h2>

            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9 September 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 6<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			<td>Throughout the project I will be working on implementing the GPS module. The focus of this week was to research GPS operation and possible 
				GPS modules to use. GPS receivers use a satellite constellation of at least 24 satellites to calculate potision at a given time. To do this calculation accurately the 
				receiver must be able to lock onto 4 satellites. The satellite configuration ensures that this is always possible [1].

			<td>Only basic functionality of a GPS is needed for the project to receive coordinate and alititude data. Since the functionality requried for the GPS 
				module is pretty basic, the feature that I determined to be most important is power consumption. The goggles will be battery operated for hours at 
				a time between charging. I have been looking at small modules with low consumption. Some modules, like the MTK3339 by Adafruit, have a 
				sleep mode that can be activated to lower consumption further [2]. Since the GPS will only be actively receiving when requested by the user, this 
				could be a useful fucntion.<br>
				<br>
				The next step is to aqcuire the physical GPS module and begin experimenting with its functionality.
